            <h1>Security Considerations</h1>
            <p>The first security consideration I have identified is that, currently, you do not need a login to access the Admin page of the website. As a result, this means any user would be able to go on to the page and use the admin tools without and restrictions, which could lead to users being able to mess with the site and cause disruptions for the company. If a user were to use the admin tools to add a new holiday that is not offered by the company, which would lead to users thinking holidays are available when they might not be, leaving the website vulnerable to manipulation.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I have also identified that the site does not hide any of its code, which could lead to users exploiting vulnerabilities if any are found. This would be bad for the company, and it is a major security risk, as it means that attackers could potentially be able to steal private data from the site since everything is visible just by using inspect element. In addition to this, attackers could manipulate and break the website, essentially grinding the companyâ€™s business to a halt and causing them possible massive losses in bookings.</p>
