# web-tech-assessment
 Code repo for my Web Technologies assignment from university.

 This site uses a combination of HTML, PHP, CSS and SQL. HTML is used for the more basic and simple pages whereas PHP is used for pages that interact with the database or need to pull information from it.
 SQL is used to hold the database contents and to query the database from pages on the site to pull relevant information. And I chose to use a global style sheet to keep the overall look and UX of the site consistent.

 The wireframes were made in Adobe Photoshop rather than Adobe XD as I have more experience with Photoshop and I am more comfortable using it.
